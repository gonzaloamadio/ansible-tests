#We can create a file that tells all of the servers in the “servers” group to connect using the root user.

#To do this, we will create a directory in the Ansible configuration structure called group_vars. Within this folder, we can create YAML-formatted files for each group we want to configure:

#sudo mkdir /etc/ansible/group_vars
#sudo nano /etc/ansible/group_vars/servers

#We can put our configuration in here. YAML files start with “—”, so make sure you don’t forget that part.

#/etc/ansible/group_vars/servers
#---
#ansible_ssh_user: root

#Save and close this file when you are finished.
#If you want to specify configuration details for every server, regardless of group association, you can put those details in a file at /etc/ansible/group_vars/all. Individual hosts can be configured by creating files under a directory at /etc/ansible/host_vars.
